That means they're really not free after all.You can look at them, play with them, take them out on dates, buy themflowers... but you can't print anything with them without paying.Payment is in the form of a toy. Since I am a robot that refuses to growup, send me a cool toy and consider the font paid for.(Robot toys get a special bonus in return!)Want to send me money?  A toy?  A robot?  Some pie?
